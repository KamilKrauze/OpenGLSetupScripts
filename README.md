# OpenGL Setup Scripts
> NOTE: This does use premake5 to generate your project files.
> You can get it at [Premake home](https://premake.github.io/).

Basic scripts for generating necessary project files for OpenGL+GLFW projects.

The scripts files are primarly meant to interface with the [OpenKrauze3D project](https://github.com/KamilKrauze/OpenKrauzeEngine), however feel free to modify this code to your liking.
They assume you have a thirdparty folder that has [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) and [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb/tree/master).
